## How to Test the Full System

### Option 1: Web Interface (Easiest)
1. Visit: http://ai-clothing-images-unique-12345-frontend.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
2. Select gender (Male/Female/Unisex)
3. Upload a full-body photo
4. Click "Get Size Recommendation"
5. View results with confidence scores and measurements

### Option 2: cURL (Command Line)
```bash
curl -X POST https://y1pkxt85mk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/analyze \
  -F "image=@your_photo.jpg" \
  -F "gender=male"
```

### Option 3: Python
```python
import requests

url = "https://y1pkxt85mk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/analyze"
files = {'image': open('photo.jpg', 'rb')}
data = {'gender': 'male'}

response = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)
print(response.json())
```

## Expected Response Format

```json
{
  "request_id": "uuid-here",
  "recommended_size": "M",
  "confidence": 85,
  "explanation": "Good fit. Size M is recommended for your measurements.",
  "measurements": {
    "chest": 96.5,
    "waist": 78.2,
    "hips": 98.1,
    "inseam": 81.3,
    "shoulder": 45.7,
    "arm": 63.2
  },
  "all_size_scores": {
    "XS": 45.2,
    "S": 67.8,
    "M": 85.3,
    "L": 72.1,
    "XL": 58.9,
    "XXL": 42.5
  }
}
```

## Photo Guidelines for Best Results

✅ **DO:**
- Use full-body photos (head to toe visible)
- Stand facing the camera
- Wear form-fitting clothes
- Use good lighting
- Stand 6-8 feet from camera
- Keep arms slightly away from body
- Use plain background

❌ **AVOID:**
- Baggy or loose clothing
- Sitting or crouching poses
- Side or angled views
- Poor lighting
- Cluttered backgrounds
- Partial body shots

## Technical Details

### AWS Resources
- **Lambda Function:** ai_clothing_size_recommender (3GB RAM, 60s timeout)
- **API Gateway:** HTTP API with CORS enabled
- **ECR:** Container image (1.6GB)
- **S3:** Frontend bucket + image storage bucket

### Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Python 3.11, FastAPI, MediaPipe, OpenCV
- **Frontend:** React 18, Axios
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform, Docker, AWS Lambda (Container)
- **AI/ML:** MediaPipe Pose estimation, custom measurement algorithms

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "No person detected" error:
- Make sure the full body is visible in the photo
- Ensure good lighting
- Use a front-facing photo
- Try a different photo

### If you get timeout errors:
- The Lambda function has a 60-second timeout
- First request may take longer (cold start ~10-15 seconds)
- Subsequent requests should be faster (~3-5 seconds)

### If measurements seem off:
- The system uses average human proportions for scale estimation
- Works best with standard poses
- Form-fitting clothes provide more accurate measurements

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real photos** to validate accuracy
2. **Collect feedback** from users
3. **Fine-tune size charts** based on actual customer data
4. **Add authentication** for production use
5. **Implement CloudFront** for better performance
6. **Add analytics** to track usage patterns
